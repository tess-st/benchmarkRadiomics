# benchmarkRadiomics

We provide a benchmark framework for radiomics-based survival analysis, aimed at identifying the optimal settings with respect to different radiomics data sources and various ML pipeline variations, including preprocessing techniques and learning algorithms.

Keywords: radiomics, CT imaging data, colorectal cancer, survival, machine learning, benchmark, mlr3.
